What is this repository about?
This repository contains all the source code for a Destiny lore website that I am currently creating. This project will be ongoing for me as Destiny 2 will continue to update its lore and I wanted to create a website that holds all of these. Many other websites are doing the same thing, but I wanted to try it.

The main reason for creating this project is to further my knowledge within React and TailwindCSS as I am currently learning those libraries. 

Why did I do it about Destiny and Destiny 2?
I have been a massive fan of the Destiny franchise and still am. I am hooked on their lore for the game which is what pulled me in the first place. I started playing Destiny when the Beta was out on Xbox 360 and have been playing ever since all the way up to the current state of the game and I am still enjoying it. 

What am I planning to add to the website?
I am planning on adding all the lore such as:
- Books
- Grimoire Cards
- Documentation:
    - Items
    - Artifacts
    - Interactions
    - Records
    - Lore Entries
